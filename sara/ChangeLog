PURPOSE
Version 1.14-unreleased
=======================

* set dependency to PNAPI version 4.03

Version 1.13 (24 Sep 2013)
==========================

* small fixes to allow compilation under OS X

Version 1.12 (23 Aug 2013)
==========================

* bug fixes for examples by Andras Vörös

Version 1.10 (22 Jun 2012)
==========================

* towards parallelisation: multithreaded search in firing sequence tree

* towards parallelisation: multithreaded job execution

* option -T reassigned, -threads=n tells Sara to use n additional threads

* dynamic assignment of threads to the two different tasks

* speed up of code in PathFinder, esp. stubborn sets and diamond checks

* installed thread-safe lp_solve

Version 1.09 (15 May 2012)
==========================

* added utility to convert LoLA formulae/tasks to Sara problem files

Version 1.08 (22 May 2011)
==========================

* bug fix: partial solutions dropped when new transition were added but
  never fired

Version 1.07 (12 Apr 2011)
==========================

* added option -M to limit the solution length for finding minimal solutions

* last output changes for the model checking contest

Version 1.06 (08 Apr 2011)
==========================

* bug fix: lost constraints led to false negatives

* initial marking read from net if missing in problem statement

* local changes to PNML parser to use name tags for IDs

* allowing for dummy problem statements

Version 1.05 (25 Mar 2011)
==========================

* added output option for simple yes/no

* multiple problems can be logically ORed

Version 1.04 (03 Nov 2010)
==========================

* wrapped Sara into the namespace sara

* added entry point for using Sara as a library

Version 1.03 (16 Sep 2010)
==========================

* added property checks for quasiliveness, proper completion, lazy &
  relaxed soundness to owfn2sara

* extended problem specification so Sara can properly answer questions
  about the above properties

Version 1.02 (07 Sep 2010)
==========================

* added option -show for dot output of solutions and counterexamples

* added utility to detect final marking in owfn net and create a problem
  instance

Version 1.01 (13 Aug 2010)
==========================

* fixed bug in counterexample generation where information from different
  sources (jobs) could not be coordinated and eventually got lost.

Version 1.0 (12 Jul 2010)
=========================

* first release of Sara

Version 0.91-unreleased (6 Jul 2010)
====================================

* adding support for PNML

* detecting type of a Petri net from the filename

Version 0.9-unreleased (3 May 2010)
===================================

* first version of Sara

* tests reachability of markings and realizability of transition vectors in
  Petri nets
