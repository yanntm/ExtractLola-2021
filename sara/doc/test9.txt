sara: Problem 1: test9
sara: Trying to solve a reachability problem with inputs:
sara: - Petri net "test9.owfn"
sara: - Initial marking i1 i2 
sara: - Final marking o1 o2 
sara: 67 jobs done, 0 in queue, 4 failures, 0 solutions.
sara: INFEASIBLE: unable to borrow enough tokens via T-invariants.
There are firing sequences that could not be extended towards the final marking.
After the firing sequence "a1 a2 l2 b1 l3 b1 l3 l2 b1 d1 d1 d1 d1 c1 c1 c1 c1 b1":
 - need at least 1 more token on place set {o1:0,y2:4,z1:0,z2:0} to fire a transition 
   in {a3,b2,c1,c2,l1}
After the firing sequence "a1 a2 l2 b1 l3 b1 d1 d1 d1 d1 c1 c1 c1 c1 c1 b1":
 - need at least 1 more token on place set {o1:0,y1:3,z1:0,z2:0,z3:0} to fire a transition 
   in {a3,b1,b2,c2,d2,l1,l2,l3}
After the firing sequence "a1 a2 l2 b1 l3 b1 l3 c1 c1 c1 c1 c1 b1 d1 d1 d1 b1":
 - need at least 1 more token on place set {o1:0,y3:3,z1:0,z2:0,z3:0} to fire a transition 
   in {a3,b2,c2,d1,d2,l1,l2,l3}
After the firing sequence "a1 a2 a4":
 - need at least 4 more tokens on place y1:0 to fire all transitions in {a3,b2}
 - need at least 5 more tokens on place y2:0 to fire all transitions in {a3,c2}
 - need at least 4 more tokens on place y3:0 to fire all transitions in {a3,d2}
