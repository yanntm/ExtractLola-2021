sara: Problem 1: test4
sara: Trying to solve a reachability problem with inputs:
sara: - Petri net "test4.owfn"
sara: - Initial marking p1 q1 
sara: - Final marking p1:2 q1:2 
sara: 6 jobs done, 0 in queue, 1 failure, 0 solutions.
sara: INFEASIBLE: unable to borrow enough tokens via T-invariants.
There are firing sequences that could not be extended towards the final marking.
After the firing sequence "<empty>":
 - need at least 1 more token on place set {p2:0,q2:0} to fire a transition in {t1,u1}

sara: 0 Solutions produced.
