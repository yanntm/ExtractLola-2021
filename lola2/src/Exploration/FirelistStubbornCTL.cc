\brief Class for stubborn CTL firelist generation. We use a quick&dirty approach. We are just looking for a transition in a singleton conflict cluster that is
invisible. If so, it satisfies all requirements for CTL preserving stubborn 
sets (except, of course, ignorance that needs to be handled upon closing scc)
